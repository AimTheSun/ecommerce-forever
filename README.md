## ‚ö° Challenges & Difficulties

Building Forever E-commerce was no small feat! Here are the major hurdles I encountered:

- **Long Development Hours**: I dedicated **8-10 hours a day for 10 days straight** to bring this project to life. Balancing frontend polish, backend stability, and feature integration was exhausting but rewarding.  
- **Vercel Deployment Headaches**: Deploying the backend on Vercel posed significant challenges, particularly with **MongoDB** and **bcrypt**.  
  - **MongoDB**: Ensuring compatibility with Vercel‚Äôs serverless environment required tweaking connection settings and handling cold starts.  
  - **bcrypt**: Dependency issues arose due to Vercel‚Äôs build process, which I resolved by switching to a prebuilt binary and adjusting the deployment configuration.  
- **Solution**: Hours of debugging, community forums, and trial-and-error led to a stable deployment. Persistence paid off!

These challenges taught me valuable lessons in problem-solving and optimization, making the final product even more satisfying.
